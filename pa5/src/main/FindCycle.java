         *  - conduct DFS in increasing order of index to find a cycle in the given undirected graph.
         *  - if a cycle is found, save and return the alternating sequence of vertices and edges in the arraylist.
         *  - the sequence must start and end with the vertex in the cycle whose index is the smallest.
         *  - in the sequence, there will be two edges incident to the start vertex.
         *  - the edge with the larger index must come after the start vertex, and the edge with the smaller index must come before the end vertex.
         *  - if a cycle is not found, return null.
         *  - we will use a graph with only one cycle as input.
         *  - please note that the given graph may not be connected.
